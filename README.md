# PyRegex
A simple iterative NFA implementation of Regular Expressions as the grep command line tool written in Python3.

## Usage
$ python3 grep.py [regex] [-f files] [flags]  
$ python3 ls.py [files] [flags]
$ python3 tests.py  
(Note tests.py must be run from within the directory it is located in, since it simply adds the parent folder to the sys path.)  
Please see WriteUp.pdf for more information.
